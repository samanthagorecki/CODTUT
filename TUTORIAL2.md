# Lab 2:HTML

Students will work in small groups of three determined by the instructor. Groups will work together and turn in one completed lab assignment with all group member names on it. This document should be shared with ALL group members. 


All work on the lab assignment will be done during the period assigned for the lab. Students should look over the lab prior to arrival but should not do any of the exercises until working in the lab with their small groups. Students will turn in the lab assignment at the end of the lab period.


Students should arrive on time for the lab. After a 5 minute grace period, a student will lose 1 point on the lab grade for every 5 minutes that they are late.


You will get full credit for the lab if you finish the required exercises. If you finish the required exercises before the lab period ends, you are required to spend the remaining time working on the discussion and/or assignment due this week.

When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. Using a system of tags, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) lets a programmer indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page. 
An element usually consists of an opening tag and closing tag, which contain the element's name surrounded by angle brackets and the content in between:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag or any contents  such as <img> and <input>. These are called empty elements.
As you work through this part of the lab, you can always refer to the following resources on HTML:
W3Schools - HTML Tutorial
